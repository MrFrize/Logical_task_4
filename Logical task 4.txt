Performance:
First of all, I would inspect the cable for marking. Acording to the marking it has different
Max. Resolution Refresh Rate and Max. Transmission Rate. Otherwise i would connect my laptop to
tv or monitor with this cable to find out. Another way to do it would be to get specific testers
which could tell you the specs.
Usability:
Cable plug should be relevant for new tech so the user would not have to buy adapter. Also would be
nice to have soft structure allowing the user to connect his equipment even in hard-to-reach places.
Security:
I would check what insulation layer the cable has, how much it transmits signals in the state of operation.
